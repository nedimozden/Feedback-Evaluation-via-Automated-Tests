# Feedback & Evaluation via Automated Tests
## Overview
This project is a Java-based tool designed to automatically generate black box test cases for Python programs submitted by students in Rice University's Computer Science classes. The tool aims to enhance the testing process by generating comprehensive and effective test cases that can help identify bugs and issues in student submissions.

### Features
Automated Test Case Generation: Automatically creates black box test cases for Python programs, streamlining the testing process for instructors and teaching assistants.
Greedy Algorithm Implementation: Utilizes a greedy algorithm to select an approximately optimal subset of test cases. This approach addresses the hitting set problem, aiming to minimize bug detection runtime while maintaining high test coverage.
Efficiency and Optimization: Designed to reduce the time and effort required to manually create test cases, allowing for more efficient grading and feedback processes.
